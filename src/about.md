### Me

My professional career began with a big jump across the Pacific Ocean and landed a job in Education in a suburb of Seoul, Korea. After two years of teaching high-energy Korean students English, I decided to go back to school to improve myself and enroll in dual-degree program at [Cleveland State University](https://www.csuohio.edu 'visit site') for graduate school. The main reason I picked CSU was because of the dual-degree program they had with a Korean University, [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr 'visit site').

After two years I completed the program with a Masters in Urban Studies but fell back to what I did best, make websites. For a brief period I worked at a digital marketing firm as a Front-End Developer for iOS apps that were commissioned by large pharmaceutical companies. Working there was a blast and I learned a lot in a short amount of time. It took a 2-billion dollar IT Health Care company to offer me a great position to manage and develop web solutions at their 501(c)(3) organization.

10 years later, I'm ready for a new adventure!
