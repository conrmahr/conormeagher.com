<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

Not having published one blog post in five years is quite embarrassing. More importantly, what I've learned in that time has been invaluable and to hold that in my head is selfish. This is why I'm taking the advice of a Web Legend, [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com).

You would think after attending three [An Event Apart](http://www.aneventapart.com) conferences I would of started already... All joking aside, there's no better time to start (re-start) than now. The goal for me is to document the tricks, hacks, tutorials, bugs, and recommendations that I experience in everyday life. Kind of like the everyone else before me who I've learned from. Technology is an infinite continuum of knowledge that needs to be shared and found. It does no good inside the heads of really smart people.
