<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

This double-album has kept me going for hundreds, maybe thousands of hours of programming. Being a child of the '80s, the synthesizer has a special place in my heart. The way Anthony Gonzalez of [M83](http://ilovem83.com) composes all 22 tracks, is like one 80 minute continuous song. No need to skip tracks. It works best when you set "Repeat Album" and enter another world of creativity.
