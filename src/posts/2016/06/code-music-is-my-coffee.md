<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

Everyone has their own way to be creative when they code. Four cups of black coffee, a "jar" of Peanut Butter M&M'S, a 64-oz 7-Eleven Diet Dr. Pepper Big Gulp, or just music. If you are a former musician like me, than it's your preferred method. Rob Birdwell blogged about The Relationship Between Programming and Music[^1] in 2003. Then in 2009 Jeff Atwood from Coding Horror revisited it with The One Thing Programmers and Musicians Have In Common[^2].

Every website I've built has an album that helped me build it. Even the first one wasn't possible without The Bends by Radiohead.

There would be many others. Others that I will share using this tag: [#Code Music](/tags/Code%20Music/)

Enjoy.
