<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

Today is National Donut Day and my kid-like mind is disappointed not to find a `:donut:` emoji code[^1], but only the `:doughnut:` code in [Slack](https://slack.com).

This delicious Salvation Army curated day[^2], served coffee and donuts to soldiers in the trenches of World War I. Now it needs to be celebrated throughout the internets in binary form without regional linguistical bias and don't forget free _overpriced_ donuts!

P.S. - I ❤ Slack.
