Less than a month after publishing the following post, _[Cut the Cord Please](/posts/2018/01/cut-the-cord-please/)_, a number of paid over-the-top content providers[^1] flooded the market. This gave the consumer (me) more options to weigh; Sling TV, YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, DirecTV Now, Amazon Prime Video, Playstation Vue, fuboTV, Philo, Acron TV. During Super Bowl LII, this [YouTube TV Super Bowl Kickoff Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIsiitITIes) played about 100x in front of my eyes. The $35 price point and stunning UI made me re-evaluate my current plan seen below.

> My self-survey came back as sports, sports, and a lot of HBO. Thatâ€™s why I went with Sling TV Orange/Blue + Cloud DVR & Sports Extra.

Starting a YTTV free 7-day trial made me immediately realize after logging in I was not getting the most for my money and using a far inferior product. Then when I did a simple comparison by dollars, I was roughly paying $15 more for just the NHL Network. But it wasn't just that, it was the YTTV core features that made it elite:

- Local Affiliate Channels[^2]
- 1200x720@60fps Channels
- Excellent Latency on Google Fiber
- Unlimited Cloud DVR Storage (9 months)
- Hi-Res Guide Display
- tvOS Integration

I cut the cord again with [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com) and haven't looked back.
