The day that Google Fiber was installed in my front yard was a day I'll never forget.[^1] Gigabit internet, 100's of Channels, a 2 TBs DVR, it was all making my mouth water.

But it was pricey. Fiber 1000 + TV base price was $130 when signing up last year and $120 originally. The 1000Mbps for $70 was always worth it because of the value. Gigabit internet is 1000Mbps, that's roughly 14.28Mbps per dollar! For the TV service, it was always a little rich for my blood. Then I got this...

### Choosing Your Subscriptions

Choosing what services to subscribe to can be overwhelming. But doing a simple survey of all the channels you watch regularly or must have is a good practice to start with. Then you can eliminate the services that don't fit your watching habits by looking at a channel comparison chart.[^2] Or maybe you don't need a traditional channels, but Netflix and/or Hulu Plus work just fine.

### Building My Plan

My self-survey came back as sports, sports, and a lot of HBO. That's why I went with Sling TV Orange/Blue + Cloud DVR & Sports Extra. It had the best channels for the NHL (NHL Network) or the English Premier League (NBC Sports), which are usually extra or not available at all. To get a weekly dose of Last Week Tonight or a full season of Game of Thrones, I subscribe to [HBO NOW](https://www.hbonow.com) independently to use their far superior designed app. But the biggest challenge when cutting the cord is watching your local affiliates. The [Mohu Leaf Ultimate Flat 50 Mile](https://amzn.to/2WpSShs) works for my in my suburb location. Those who live in the city may only need a 30 Mile though. With having Gigabit internet, I've also set up a Gigabit network at my home so I can hardwire my [Apple TV 4K](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k) via a network cable. Apple TV users: Make sure that you know that the Apple TV 4th Generation or older, **do not support gigabit speeds**.[^3]
