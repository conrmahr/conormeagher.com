This eponymous debut album by [American Football](http://www.americanfootballmusic.com) sparks your memory of what it's like to be a teenager in the late 90's and early 00's. The repeating guitar arpeggios and dream like pace with the low-volume vocals makes it a treat to code too. This album has helped code many websites along with deal with tons of heartbreak. The whole album is only 9 tracks averaging around 4 mins a pop, so it's an easy listen and a great album to put on repeat.
