Setting up an interview can be one of the most exciting and scary events if you are not prepared. The interview questions can be straight-forward as _"What are your career goals"_ to complex behavior questions such as _"Give me an example of a challenge you experienced and how you dealt with it"_.

How can you prepare to answer these open-ended behavioral, emotional, and story telling questions that they may ask you?

### Look to the STARs!

[Situation-Task-Action-Result](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result)

If the STAR technique is new to you, then read more from [The MIT Career Office - Successful Interviewing Techniques](http://web.mit.edu/career/www/workshops/interviewing.pdf) (PDF).

### Let's take it one step further for the digitally inclined.

Look at the job posting you're interviewing for. Do you see keywords to match your STAR responses? Some might overlap.

Now **PRACTICE** by answering any of these [Behavioral Interview Questions](http://career-advice.monster.com/job-interview/interview-questions/100-potential-interview-questions/article.aspx) from Monster. Matching your keywords with the questions will make your responses prepared for any behavioral question.
