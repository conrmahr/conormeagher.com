_This post is one of the series of posts in my [S.T.A.R. Answers Series](/posts/2011/02/star-responses/) in which I response to behavioral interview questions from my experiences._

**Question:** Give me an example of a time when you were successful in communicating with a difficult person(s) or circumstance?

### Situation

A class of 30 Korean Graduate students with advanced to beginner level of English abilities.

### Task

Teach a non-language subject to a wide range of English abilities in a Graduate level class.

### Action

Taught with visual methods using PowerPoint, class presentations, and group work.

### Result

All students improved their own language ability and were comfortable communicating to myself along with their peers at the end of the semester.
