_This post is one of the series of posts in my [S.T.A.R. Answers Series](/posts/2011/02/star-responses/) in which I response to behavioral interview questions from my experiences._

**Question:** Describe a time when you came up with a creative solution/idea/project/report to a problem in your past work.

### Situation

A University updated their daily annoucements and events manually to the website front page through their Web Manager.

### Task

To skip this tedious process and allow multiple co-workers to add announcements and events to the website front page instantaneously.

### Action

Created a Twitter account and embeded it's feed in the main page using JavaScript and CSS which allowed all office members to add their content at anytime.

### Result

The University saw an increase in applications and a 13% increase in student enrollment the semester after it was implemented. But most importantly, it gave more flexibility and time efficiency to the office workflow.
