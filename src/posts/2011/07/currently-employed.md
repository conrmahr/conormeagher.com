That's right, I got a j-o-b. Two actually. When it rain it pours. Thanks to all that helped and provided advice. For those still looking, **DON'T GIVE UP!** The hard work will pay off.

> _Here's my success story:_ After a great month in April of applying for jobs and doing good interviews, Company A offered me a contract job at very nice hourly rate, but the week before starting, I had another interview with Company B. Started at Company A, loved it. Didn't hear back from Company B until 3 weeks later. Got a call to do an early morning phone interview, but they gave me no indication if they would offer me a job. That was fine, since I was happy with working at Company A until Company B would call me and offer me the job. It was a full-time permanent position with benefits and a great company to grow with. At this point, most people will be content with what they have, but when a fair salary was mutually agreed upon between us, the decision was made without me having to think about it. It was tough to say goodbye to the great people I just started to get to know, but they understood and agreed that it was the right decision. Now I'm working at Company B and having a blast! Lots of amazing things happening here and hope to make a major impact.
