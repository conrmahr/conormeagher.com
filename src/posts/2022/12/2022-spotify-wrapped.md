Wow, 2022 is ending in a couple of hours. What a great year of growth and productivity. One thing that helped with that was switching from Apple Music to Spotify. The interface, music library, and shareability are top-notch. I frequently binged on my [144 BPM playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1PYjhP7IagKgGMaQVxvYiF?si=0091ec72aa14420d) to keep my JavaScript or newly learned TypeScript code fresh and flowing. [80's Cheese](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7mncNgMcNKRMh3I2N5Lu6g?si=9f988332e9fa44de) was a fun way to re-live my childhood during a weird decade while coding in a modern era. The best part is that this is my first year to open my [Spotify Wrapped](https://www.newsroom.spotify.com/2022-wrapped/) present. Yay!
